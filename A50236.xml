            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Holy Prophets of Old, did in a special manner Preach and Write against the prevailing Iniquities of the Age and place wherein they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And the Lord Jesus has by his own most Holy Example▪ taught his Ministers to do t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e like. Yea, though they should be exposed to great Sufferings from the World on that account, having declared that it shall</hi> turn to them for a Testimony <hi>of their Faithfulness to Him, whose Servants and whose Witnesses they are. Such like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, have caused me to look upon it as my Duty, both Living and Dying, to enter my</hi> Humble Testimony <hi>for the the ways of Christ, and against those things which I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced are directly Opposite thereunto; and I have therefore Written what cometh hereafter. Since the Composure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is much discourse of beginning of</hi> Stage-Plays <hi>in</hi> New-England. <hi>The last Year</hi> Promiscuous Dancing <hi>was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised, and too much countenanced in this Degenerated Town. There was, in the day of it, a</hi> Testimony <hi>published against that Evil, by the Ministers of Christ in this place; amongst whom I am the least. If we should now behold things as bad or worse coming in upon us, and be altogether silent, I know not how we should be able to answer it to him, who has set us as</hi> Watchmen to the House of Israel, <hi>and most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly charged us to shew unto them their Iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as for</hi> Stage-Plays, <hi>the Evil thereof has been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered by several of our English Writers; particularly▪ by Mr.</hi> Stubbs, <hi>Mr.</hi> Perkins, <hi>Dr.</hi> Ames, <hi>and by Mr.</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

The Reader is refer'd to the Books mentioned for further satisfaction; I must but very briefly Suggest a few things here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Stage-Plays had their Original from those Devil-Gods whom the Gentiles Worshiped. <hi>The Infernal Spirits did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly command that men should use such Recreations, which we may be sure they would never have done, were not such
<pb facs="tcp:47038:3"/> Pastimes displeasing to God, and dangerous to the Souls of Men.</hi> Austin (de Civitate Dei Lib. 4. Cap. 26.) <hi>Relates that</hi> Titus Latinus <hi>was by a</hi> Daemon <hi>told that he should declare to the Senate that they ought to renew their</hi> Stage-Plays; <hi>He neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to deliver his Message, was again by the</hi> Daemon <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon; and a Third time; the Issue was, that</hi> Stage-plays <hi>were revived more then ever.</hi> Valesius (<hi>a rich</hi> Roman) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Prayed to his</hi> Houshold Gods <hi>for the Recovery of his Children, who were dangerously sick of the Pestilence, he was by them bidden to give them Water to drink taken from beside the Altar of</hi> Pluto; <hi>which having done, they recovered, and the Infernal Spirits required him in way of Gratitude to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate</hi> Night Plays. <hi>See</hi> Polydor.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For Men who call themselves Christians, to do that which is contrary to their Vow in Baptism, must needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Evil. <hi>But this is sadly true concerning</hi> Stage-Plays. <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Persons are under Obligation to renounce all the</hi> Pomps of Satan; <hi>and therefore to Abhor and Abandon</hi> Stage-Plays, <hi>which bear a principal part in the</hi> Pomps the of Devil. <hi>Thus</hi> Salvian (de provid. Dei. Lib. 6.) <hi>Argueth,</hi> In <hi>Stage-Plays</hi> (saith he) there is an Apostasy from the Faith, men in Baptism profess that they Renounce the <hi>Devil,</hi> his <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Shows;</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is in his <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Plays.</hi> If then thou dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Stage-Plays,</hi> thou dost leave the Faith of Christ, and return again to serve <hi>Satan. Thus did that Faithful Minister of God Declare and Testify against the Degenerate Christians of that Apostatizing Age wherein he lived. It has been prov'd
<pb facs="tcp:47038:3"/> that the Impleaded Interludes were at first Instituted for the honour of Idols, and they were a special part of the Old</hi> Ethnical Worship. <hi>Hence for Christians to take them up, is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to Renounce the Faith and Allegiance which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Lord in their Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis the usual practice of <hi>Stage-Players</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others merry with the Vices and Wickednesses of men. <hi>Now this is certainly Evil.

            <p n="4">4. The Natural Effects of <hi>Stage-Plays</hi> have been very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. <hi>Not to speak of the loss of precious Time, and of Estate, which might be better Improved; Multitudes (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Young Persons) have thereby been Corrupted and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly Ruined. When they have seen a lively Representation of Wickedness on the Stage, their Minds have been Vitiated, and instead of learning to hate Vice (as is Vainly pretended) they have learned to practice it.</hi> Seneca <hi>could say that nothing has a greater tendency to Corrupt good Manners, then to be at these</hi> Spectacles. <hi>It's a sad O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A more woful and effectual Course to Debauch the Young Generation▪ Satan himself cannot easily devise. I remember</hi> Austin <hi>in his</hi> Confession (Lib. 6. Cap. 8.) <hi>Reports concerning</hi> Alipius (<hi>a very hopeful Young Man whom he had a great Affection for</hi>) That he was much Importuned by some of his Acquaintance, to go along with them to see a <hi>Sword-Play.</hi> He at first denied to go along with them, but at last to please them he consented; only resolved that he would keep his Eyes shut a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> long as he continued on the Stage: but one of the Fencers being smitten so as to fall, the Spectators gave a shout, at the hearing of which, <hi>Alipius</hi> opened his Eyes. And then (saith <hi>Austin</hi>) he was struck with a deeper Wound in his Soul, then the other was in his Body; so that he fell more miserably then the <hi>Sword-Player</hi> had done, whose fall caused the mighty shout of the People. He no sooner saw another Mans Blood▪
<pb facs="tcp:47038:4"/> but at the very Instant drank down a kind of <hi>Savageness;</hi> being much taken with the Barbarousness of the <hi>Sword-Fight,</hi> and made Drunk with that Bloody Pastime. Nor was he now the Man he was when he first came thither, but became an entire Companion of them, who brought him to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater. He was so Inflamed with it, and carried home with him such a measure of Madness, as that he came another time, nay ran before them who first enticed him, and haled on others to do so too. And in this course continued a long time, but God was pleased at last by a strong and merciful Hand to Convert him. <hi>Thus far is</hi> Austins <hi>Relation, by which we see how dangerous it is for Persons (especially young Ones) to go to a</hi> Stage-Play, <hi>or to behold a</hi> Sword-Fight; <hi>God may be provoked thereby to give them up to walk in the ways of their Heart, and in the sight of their Eyes.

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. Cap. 5. p. 39.</note> in his Book <hi>de Ritu Bibendi super Sanitate Magnatum,</hi> has described enough of them. An Health is not mearly ones saying when he Drinks to another, that he wisheth the Health of such a Person present or absent; Nevertheless, where the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47038:6"/> using of such Expressions proves any way offensive, to be sure <hi>Tutius est abstinere,</hi> it is Charity to forbear them. But <hi>an Health is that which doth Oblige men to Drink such a quantity of Liquor, as an Indication of their Praying for the Health or Prosperity of such a Person, or of such a Design.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to this Description, we conceive, That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ought not, nor can he without Sin against God, either Pledge or Drink an Health. And the more especial Reasons which sway our Consciences in this matter, are these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Christians ought not to retain any Remainders of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism.</hi> It is confessed by all, that as to Natural Actions which belong to men as men, it doth not follow, that because the Heathen have so practised it of Old, that Christians who succeed them may not do the same things. But in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and things of a Religious Nature, they are not to be imitated. To <hi>Dedicate a Cup,</hi> or <hi>Consecrate an Health,</hi> is not an Action purely Natural or Moral. The Worldly and Vain Customs of the Gentiles are not to be taken up by such as profess themselves to be the Servants of the True God in Christ. The Holy Scriptures do clearly, expresly, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prohibit all Symbolizing with the Heathens, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>You shall not walk in the manners of the Nations.</hi> See also <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Learn not the way of the Heathen.

But that the impleaded Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not first practised amongst the People of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47038:6"/> Christians or Jews of Old, is past all dispute; Learned men, who have written on this Subject, shew how it is amongst the <hi>Reliques of Paganism,</hi> which has through the Papacy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerated it self into the sink of a decaying World. Instead of many, I shall only produce <hi>Austin</hi>'s Testimony, which does suficiently confirm what has been asserted. <note n="b" place="margin">De Tempore, Serm. 131.</note> His words are these, <hi>Illa foeda &amp; infoelix Consuetudo, per quam grandi Mensurâ, sine Mensurâ, solent bibere, de Paganorum observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione remansit; Ideò tanquam Venenum Diaboli de vestris Conviviis respuatis.</hi> That filthy and unhappy Custom (saith <hi>Austin</hi>) of <hi>Drinking Healths is a Relique of Paganism,</hi> and let Christians banish it from their Feasts and Tables, as the Poyson of the Devil. Thus has the great <hi>Austin</hi> expressed himself above 1200 years ago. Health-Drinkers may call him a <hi>Phanatic,</hi> if they please.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Practice which was in its first Institution abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Idolatrous, and which has still in it an appearance of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, ought not at all to be used amongst Christians.</hi> The first and great Commandment of the Moral Law confirms this Proposition; and so do all those Scriptures which require men to flee from Idolatry, and not to tolerate any <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Remembrances of Idolatry</hi> amongst them; The Holy Word of God abounds with Precepts of this nature.

               <p>But let us consider a little the chief <hi>Pleas</hi> and Arguments which are made use of to justifie this unhappy Custom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some argue, <hi>If a Remembrance of an absent Friend, when one drinks, is lawful, then an Health is so; But you are not so humorous as to scruple that.</hi> Answ. The Consequence is denied. For a Remembrance and an Health are not the same. The Primitive Christians <note n="a" place="margin">Clem. Alex. Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dag. l. 2. c. 2.</note> had their <hi>Pocula Amicitiae,</hi> which was the same thing with our Drinking one to another, and Remembring our absent Friends. But they had no Healths among them, as we have shewed. In a Remembrance (as it is called) a man is not obliged to drink up the whole Cup. Nor is the Person to whom he drinks obliged to pledge him, except he seeth cause. He is left to his Liberty to Pledge where, and in what, and how he pleases, which things are contrary to the Laws of an Health. A Remembrance is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Friends and Equals, when as an Health is commonly to Superiors. So that these two differ the whole Heaven over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some excuse the Matter by saying, They do not compel others to Pledge them when they drink an Health. Answer,</hi> This is so far well. I wish all could say so. Nevertheless, It should be considered, that the very Beginning of an Health has some kind of Compulsion in it. Especially when the <hi>Exorcism</hi> of a Great Name is added to the health. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath not Power and Courage to withstand the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of such an Adjuration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are who excuse themselves by pleading, <hi>They are loth to be Ʋncivil, or that any should take occasion to think them morose and ill-humored. Answer,</hi> The Incivility is on their part who urge the health, and not in them who out of Conscience refuse it. Nor will any Ingenuous person be offended at him who shall with Discretion and Modesty decline Pledging an Health. It was not taken offensively from that noble Statesman who said, <hi>I'le pray for the Kings Health, and drink for my own.</hi> Nor was the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> displeased with Dr. <hi>Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. It is pleaded that the famous <hi>Luther</hi> drank an Health, and other <hi>Good men have not scrupled it</hi> Answ. If <hi>Luther</hi> did any such thing upon his first coming out of Popery and Monkery, and before he saw the Evil of it, none ought to alledge his example to justify an unlawful deed. Nor is it certain that <hi>Luther</hi> did thus after his Conversion. Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant writers do not acknowledge the fact, when it has been objected to them. Only some Popish Authors tell a Story of a Prodigious Health which <hi>Luther</hi> drank to <hi>Islebius</hi> the German Antimonian. But the Papists have invented a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand lies, not only of <hi>Luther,</hi> but of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other great Reformers, in Design to cast an <hi>odium</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Protestant Religion. Besides, it is the poorest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be, <hi>Some good men have done such a thing, therefore it is lawful.</hi> It was shewed before that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Good men have declined Healths as Paganish and Scandalous things. And when any Good men have indulged themselves in this Practice, commonly it has been for want of Information, concerning the Evil of it. Had they known the true Original, and been convinced of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition attending this ill Custom, they would never have used it. Persons well inclined will harken to Scripture and Reason. And it is chiefly for the sake of such that I write these things. As for some who are now become profane and debauched <hi>Health-drinkers,</hi> there is little or no hope of their Reformation. Having lived for some time under the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dispensation of the Gospel, but sinned against that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Light, and also rebelled against the Light of their own Consciences, it is to be feared that Gods holy Spirit has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Everlasting leave of them, never more to strive with them, but that they are in a Judicial way given up by the Righteous and Terrible God unto a Reprobate mind, and hard heart.

                  <p>Against <hi>Dicing, Cards,</hi> and such like Games. That it is safest wholly to abstain from them. The <hi>Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> in them makes their Lawfulness to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Eminently Learned Divines have judged them to be in their own nature Sinful. They are of <hi>Evil Report.</hi> There is a <hi>secret Curse</hi> attending them. They are <hi>offensive.</hi> It is unquestionably Lawful to abstain from them. As such Games are commonly used, they are certainly and hainously Evil in the sight of God. The Evil of Playing for Money: and of mis-spending much Precious Time in such Vanities.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for Games of Hazard and Chance, such as <hi>Dicing and Cards, and sundry Games at Tables,</hi> there are great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (as anon we shall shew) who judge them to be in their own nature Unlawful. Others suppose that if the Rules which should be remembred in all Recreations, respecting the Time, and Measure, and Manner, and the End of them, were duly observed, they might without Sin be used. Two things we may <hi>assert.</hi> 1. That it is best and safest, wholly to abstain from the Games mentioned. 2. That as they are commonly practised, there is much Sin and Provocation to God in them. Both these I shall endeavour to clear. My first Assertion is, <hi>That it is best and safest to decline all such Games;</hi> and that for these Reasons:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47038:11"/>1. There is real weight in that Argument, commonly made use of by Divines, <hi>from the Lottery which is in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded Games, to prove that they are Breaches of the Third Commandment, and so in themselves Ʋnlawful.</hi> It is granted, that there is Art and Skill mixed in some of these Games; Nevertheless, there is a <hi>Lottery</hi> in them. Now a Lot is a serious thing not to be triffled with; the Scripture saith not only (as some would have it) of <hi>Extraordinary Lots,</hi> but of a Lot in general, that <hi>the whole Disposing</hi> (or Judgm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt) <hi>thereof is of the Lord, Prov. 16. 33. So that when the Lot is cast, God sits in Judgment.</hi> The Lot (as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">In lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</note> speaks) is as Gods Deputy, who is Judge of the World, and unto whose Providence appeal is made to decide the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> (who was a man of a very clear and accurate Judgment) well observes <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cases of Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> p. 163.</note>
                  <hi>that in the use of a Lot there are four things,</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">The first is a Casual Act done by man, as the casting of the Die. The second is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of this Act to the Determination of some particular Controversy, the ending whereof maintains Peace, Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third is Confession, that God is a Soveraign Judge to end and determine things which can no other way be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. The fourth is Supplication, that God would by the Disposition of the Lot order the Event.</q> Now from these Considerations, Grave and Great Divines have esteemed all <hi>Lusory Lots</hi> to be Unlawful. We may not either by Words or Actions invocate the Name, and make Appeals to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God on every trifling occasion. As an Oath or Prayer, so a Lot is prophaned, when not solemnly used. A worthy Person <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Morton <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gaming humour,</hi> p. 14.</note> speaks well to this purpose, when he saith, <hi>What an Abomination would it be to any Christian to see a Pulpit, a Communion-Table, a Font exposed on a Stage, or the Gestures of Worship aped by Players?</hi> And it is not much better, when men play with Appeals to God, or make themselves sport with Lotteries. Whereas some have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Lot fittest for trivial matters, their Assertion is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound. We do not find in the Scripture, that ever a Lot was made use of, except in matters of great weight, either in themselves, or in respect of their Consequences; sometimes when the matter has not been great in it self, yet to prevent endless Contentions and Controversies, a Lot has been used amongst the Lords People of Old, <hi>Lev. 27. 32. Prov.</hi> 18. 18. but not in matters of Disport. The very Gentiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thought there was a <hi>Ti Theion,</hi> something Divine in a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47038:12"/> Lot, as is manifest from <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nah</hi> 1. 7. They concluded that some <hi>Numen</hi> or <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity</hi> must needs direct their Chance, which (being ignorant of the True God) they did superstitiously ascribe to Fortune. And do not Gamesters at this day use to say, <hi>They'll try their Fortune:</hi> And that <hi>they had bad Luck, that Fortune was against them,</hi> and the like Paganish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, by which nevertheless they acknowledge a Director of the Chance. This must be either God, which if they confess, the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

He that makes use of a Lot, wholly commits his Affair to a superior Cause then either Nature or Art, therefore unto God. But this ought not to be done in a Sportful Lusory way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Practices, which eminenly Learnedly Divines and Holy Ministers of God, who are most likely to know the Truth, have looked upon as Sinful, it is best and safest to abstain from them.</hi> But this is true of the Games in question. I know that Popish Casuists (who in matters of Morality, as well as in matters of Faith, are many times corrupt) do justify the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded Games as Lawful. So <hi>Tolet, A Lapide, Delrio,</hi> and others. Yet Papists will not allow of such Games in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons. One of them <note n="d" place="margin">Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Lopez.</note> maintains it to be a Mortal Sin for a Clergy-man to play at Cards and Dice. Several Councils have made it a Crime worthy of Excommunication, for a Clergy-men either to Practise or to be present at such Games.

                  <hi>Balduinus</hi> (a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Casuist) excuseth them. Also, our Learned <hi>Gataker</hi> has taken more pains to prove the Indifference of them, then any I have seen.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47038:13"/> in other things, to do in these matters as they do, though perhaps not altogether in the like Degree.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>If there were nothing else to be said, but that the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of such Games is doubtfull, that's enough to make wise men to abstain from them.</hi> Suppose it could not be clearly proved that they are absolutely and in their own nature sinfull, yet if the matter be any way disputable, tis Best &amp; Safest to keep clear of them. Iam sure there is no sin in not playing at Cards and Dice. And then as long as there are other Recreations enough, concerning which there is no Doubt of their Lawfulness; it is best to desist wholly from them that are Doubtful, and make use of others. These things make good what I first proposed. My second assertion, is, <hi>That the impleaded Games, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practised, are unquestionably sinful and provoking to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is common for such Gamesters to play away their Estates, or to get other mens Estates in this way, both which are exceeding sinfull.</hi> When God has possessed a man of an Estate which he has a just Title unto, now for him to make it a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether this Estate shall be his or another mans, and then to decide the controversy by the shuffling of Cards or the cast of a Die, is unworthily to abuse the good Providence of God, and so to transgress the third Commandment. This is also to break the 8th Commandment in a very High Degree. To get another mans goods, at an under price is injustice and theft, and clearly against the Rule of Righteousness, how much more to take from another his Money, and give him nothing at all in lieu thereof? It is a crying sin! Who can, who dare pray to God to bless his endeavours to get an Estate in this way? Most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Holy God who hates Robbery for Burnt-offering, would not hold the man guiltless that should thus take his name in vain: whenas all lawfull wayes of adding to our Estates may and should be prayed over. That worthy and truely Religious Gentleman Mr. <hi>John Bruen</hi> (see his life written by Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> p. 91.) was wont to say, that such <hi>Gamesters and Thieves were of the same Corporation, &amp; the more cunning men are in that Art, the more wicked.</hi> And a late writer observes that <hi>Money gotten by Gaming is like the goods of them that dye of the plague, which commonly bring a Pest with them.</hi> He that shall add but a little to his Estate by getting money from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any such unrighteous way, will perhaps find that little to be like a Moth that shall consume, and bring a secret Blast of God upon all that he enjoyes. And <hi>He that gets Riches and not by Right</hi> (the man that gets a summ of Money by playing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47038:13"/> at Cards, has gotten Riches and not by Right) <hi>He shall leave them in the midst of his Dayes, and at his end be a Fool.</hi> Jer. 17. 11. I would seriously advise all such persons, so far as they are capable, to return back their ill gotten goods again, as ever they desire pardoning Mercy at the Hands of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they have grievously sinned. That saying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi> is well known, and generally approved of, <hi>Non tollitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum.</hi> He that has in a way of unrighteousness taken from another any part of his Estate, has no reason to expect the remission of his sin, until such time as he shall make restitution to the party wronged by him, so far as he is able to do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A world of precious Time (more precious then all mens Estates) is commonly spent in these vain and vexatious sports.</hi> For a Christian to use Recreations is very Lawfull, and in some cases a great Duty, but to waste so much Time in any Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though never so innocent and laudable, as Gamesters usually do at Cards and Dice, and Tables, is haynously sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Every mans Eternity in another world, will be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his improvement of time here. What a sad account will they be able to give to the Son of God at the last Day, who have spent a very great part of that Time wherein they should have bin preparing for eternity, in nothing but idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness &amp; playes? What can there be more contrary to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precept of <hi>Redeeming the Time, because the Dayes are Evil?</hi>

               <p>Let it be further added here, that except we could know the hour of the day when our Saviour came into the world, (which no man living does, and it would be sinfull curiosity to enquire concerning it) it cannot be proved that it was on December 25.

               <p>It is also objected. That Christ manifested his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Feast of Dedication,</hi> by his walking in the Porch of the Temple at that Time, <hi>John</hi> 10. 22, 23. And yet that Feast was made Anniversary by <hi>Judas Maccabaeus.</hi> But it is answered <note n="w" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey <hi>of Holidays in answer to Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, p. 418. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that Christ's walking there was no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Feast. Our Saviour might walk in the Porch of the Temple, and yet not approve all that was done there, at that time. Nor is there the least Evidence of Christ's going up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that so he might keep that Feast, or that he was present at it as a Feast. When <hi>Paul</hi> hasted to be at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> before Pentecost, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 16. it was not to keep that Feast, but for other Reasons. And undoubtedly, if the Feast of Dedication was a Tradition of the Elders, Christ, who was for Divine Institutions only in matters of Religion, never manifested his Approbation of it. When <hi>Solomon</hi> had built the Temple, he made a Feast at the Dedication of it, but he did not command that it should be stated and anniversary. The like is to be said of the second Temple in <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 16. And therefore it may be questioned whether <hi>Judas Maccabaeus</hi> did not go beyond his Commission, when upon Repairing and Purifying of the Temple after its Defilement by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he made it a Law that eight Days should be observed in a stated Anniversary way, to commemorate that Mercy. Some <note n="x" place="margin">Weems <hi>vol. 1. cap.</hi> 3. p. 60.</note> have truly observed, that the <hi>Jews</hi> in their declining times appointed several Fasts and Feasts which they had no warrant for out of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>It is further alledged that the <hi>Jews</hi> did of themselves state a Fast on the Fifth Month, because of the Temple's being burnt in that Month, and another Fast in the Seventh Month, on account of <hi>Gedaliah</hi>'s being then murthered, <hi>Zachar. 7. 5.

               <p>Now for Christians thus to practise, is against clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which commands the Lords People not to learn the way of the Heathen, nor do after their manner, <hi>Jer. 10. 2.

How do the Gentiles shame us? who are more true to their Religion than we are to ours. None of them will observe the Lords-Day for fear lest they should be Christians: And shall not we then by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their Festivals, fear least we be made Ethnic's?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might take notice of the <hi>Ethnicism</hi> of this Festival in another respect. It was the manner of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to celebrate the Birth-days of their Princes and Patrons.

No Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture belonging to <hi>this</hi> World would ever have been misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had not the Sin of Man caused it to be so. And the whole Creation groans to be delivered from that woful Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which Man has subjected it unto. Wherefore for Men to make sport with the Griefs and Dolours of miserable Creatures, is such <hi>Barbarism,</hi> as a truly Christian Heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but abhor. Such Cruelty is more suitable to be acted in the Bloody Theaters of Pagans, then to be seen in the Streets amongst men that call themselves Christians. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a serious Passage mentioned in the Life of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Minister Mr. <hi>John Machin, &amp;c.</hi> He on a time meeting some young men that were going to a Cock-fighting, said to one of them, <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Clarkes <hi>last Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of Lives,</hi> p. 92.</note>
                  <hi>Friends, our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, never came into the World to set up such sports as these.</hi> Which words struck like an Arrow in the Heart of that young man, and the issue was, that he repented, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47038:20"/> there was a blessed change in his whole course of life. If the writing of these things shall have the like Effect on any Reader, my Labour will not be lost. The Lord grant that it may be so. More I need not add on this Subject, only that I find in the Ecclesiastical Discipline of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France, Cap. 14. Artic.</hi> 18. that <hi>the keeping of Shrove-Tuesday</hi> is expresly forbidden.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Dedication of <hi>Days</hi> to the honour of <hi>Saints</hi> departed, suppose <hi>Valentin,</hi> St. <hi>Matthias,</hi> or any other, we have not one Example in the Scripture to warrant such a Practice. The Lords People of old did not so. There was no <hi>Holiday</hi> appointed to the honour of <hi>Moses</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>shua,</hi> or any of the Prophets in the Church of <hi>Israel.</hi> Nor was there a <hi>Saints-day</hi> known amongst Christians, untill such time as the Antichristian Apostacy and Idolatry begun. Many learned men have proved by <note n="o" place="margin">Rivet <hi>summae contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Tract. 2. quaest. 16.</hi>
                  </note> Testimonies out of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that the Superstition of consecrating Days to the Martyrs, was done in imitation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who dedicated Days in Devotion to their <hi>Heroes,</hi> after their death, and Christians thought to bring the Heathens over to them, by appointing Festivals to the honour of Martyrs and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Saints. But this looks like worshipping Saints. And the Truth is, That the Superstition of praying to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, came in with that of Instituting Days to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And the Arguments made use of by Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst building Altars or Temples for the honour of Saints, are valid in this case. Religious worship is due to God only, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. Now that a Festival or Holiday is a part of Religious Worship, is not only by Protestants afferted, but by some Papists (in particular by <note n="p" place="margin">Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. l. 4. c. 39.</note>
                  <hi>Durandus</hi> and <note n="q" place="margin">De Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Sancte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, l. 4. cap. 16.</note>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) acknowledged. How the Observers of such Days can wholly clear themselves from transgressing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, I confess my self unable to discern.</p>
               <p>But my Design is not to enlarge on these things. What has been spoken may suffice for a <hi>Testimony</hi> against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded growing Evils. It is deeply to be lamented, that there should be any need to Preach or to Write against any such Vanities here in <hi>New-England.</hi> I can remember the time, when for many years, not so much as one of all these Superstitious Customs was known to be practised in this Land. They are good no where; but in <hi>New-England</hi> they are a thousand times worse than in another place. Upon which account, there is sad cause to expect, that it will not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47038:20"/> be long before the Holy God will reveal his Displeasure from Heaven against them. This has been <hi>Immanuels</hi> Land. <hi>New-England</hi> was and ever ought to be <hi>a Land of Ʋprightness.</hi> But shall men do such things in a Land of Uprightness, where the Word of God, and the Ministers of God have taught them better? Is it no Provocation to Defile the Lord's Land? To my knowledge, the first Generation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans came into this Wilderness with hopes that their Posterity here would never be corrupted with such <hi>vain Customs.</hi> Ask such of the old Standers as are yet living, if it were not so. And the Printed <note n="‡" place="margin">

But alas! that so many of the Present Generation have so early corrupted their doings! Methinks I hear the Lord speaking to <hi>New-England</hi> as once to <hi>Israel; I planted thee a Noble Vine, wholly a Right Seed; How then art thou turned into the Degenerate Plant of a Strange Vine unto me!</hi>
